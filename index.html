        <p>-----------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p>Recently, a valuable batch of ccTLDs (Country Code Top-Level Domains) was attempted to be stolen, but this
            activity was discovered by us. We have gathered evidence and documented the entire sequence of events based
            on what we know. Additionally, we would like to remind everyone to be vigilant about their ccTLDs and, if
            necessary, take the appropriate measures to secure them.</p>
        <p>-----------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p><strong><u>START:</u></strong></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><strong>2023.9.14&nbsp;</strong>One user David (@dvcrn) tweeted,</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><img src="https://img.ax/file/49120795617a9af38d4cc.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "></p>
        <p>This means that someone attempted to take over his domain "d.pn," and he shared images clearly showing the
            complete information of the person attempting the domain takeover, with the key name "<strong>JianFei
                Wang</strong>."</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>The tweet can still be viewed at: https://twitter.com/dvcrn/status/1702217365575078152</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><strong>2023.9.19&nbsp;</strong> JianFei Wang publicly announced in a WeChat group that he had acquired the
            domain<strong>&nbsp;x.st</strong>.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><img src="https://img.oldzhg.com/file/91943a4d1b8e6ba1a2cd0.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 548px;"></p>
        <p><img src="https://himg.cf/file/452467b62db27eb5bb4f2.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 549px;"></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>But from the web page's historical snapshot (https://web.archive.org), it's not difficult to discover
            that the original owner of the domain has always been <strong>Harold</strong> (https://twitter.com/hrldcpr), 
            while the NS and owner information of the domain were changed to JianFei Wang. Initially, we had
            some doubts. Firstly, the original owner remained unchanged, indicating his attachment to this domain.
            Secondly, even if he were to sell it, the price would obviously be beyond what JianFei Wang could afford. As
            expected, the domain was successfully reclaimed by the original owner on November 21, 2023.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><strong>2023.9.23&nbsp;</strong> JianFei Wang once again publicly announced in a WeChat group that he had
            purchased a new domain:<strong>&nbsp;interesti.ng</strong>.</p>
        <p><img src="https://im.gurl.eu.org/file/d5b254f5881f48b44e28a.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 625px;"></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>At this point, we are once again alerted to the situation. Subsequently, we discovered not just one domain
            name, but several, including <strong>"eveni.ng, exciti.ng, interesti.ng, lovi.ng, morni.ng"</strong>. These
            domains were originally owned by <strong>Mark Kychma</strong>, but later, JianFei Wang's whois information
            appeared for them. However, the original owners have successfully reclaimed the domains. These domains were
            merely part of his "testing" phase.</p>
        <p><img src="https://dd.ci/file/20a996a7b1afcbbbfe948.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 625px;"></p>
        <p>Our conversation with Mark Kychma.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><strong>2023.11.4</strong>&nbsp; The whois information for "<strong>f.cd</strong>" was changed. However,
            shortly after, on November 24, 2023, the registry relocked the domain. This clearly indicates that the
            registry became aware of the change. Despite this, the WHOIS information continued to display JianFei Wang's
            details. Given that single-character ".cd" domains are generally not allowed for registration, his attempt
            to acquire this domain stands out. Unfortunately, we cannot determine how he obtained the domain, but its
            relocking contradicts the registry's regulations. For now, we won't delve further into discussing this
            particular domain.</p>
        <p><img src="https://51yes.cf/file/771307f5671f16e03b136.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 527px;"></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><strong>2023.12.10</strong> JianFei Wang once again announced in a WeChat group that he had acquired
            "<strong>x.ke</strong>."</p>
        <p><img src="https://tu.594250.xyz/file/c27a73193e21ff896e81e.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 674px;"></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>The domain name was once featured in an auction in the .ke domain, but it was later purchased by someone
            else. Therefore, we had deep suspicions about the origin of this domain until we learned from a conversation
            with <strong>Max (Nam.es)</strong> that x.ke is listed for sale on https:// 1-single-letter-domains. com.
        </p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><img src="https://img.123798.xyz/file/36e6e503c728123eeebbc.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable ">
        </p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>However, considering the asking price, it doesn't seem like a domain JianFei Wang would be willing to spend
            money on and could afford. Nevertheless, there is currently no substantial evidence indicating that the
            domain was stolen. As of today, the domain name is still in his possession.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><img src="https://pic.kkp.nz/file/5444fefa77610f5da087c.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 514px;"></p>
        <p>-----------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p><strong><u>Rampant Plunder:</u></strong></p>
        <p><strong>2024.1.11</strong> We inadvertently discovered that the owner of the domain wm.mw had changed. Here
            is the WHOIS information from August 2023:</p>
        <p><img src="https://img.zote.eu.org/file/c1ff2eefaf685a70cdf63.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable ">
        </p>
        <p>On November 15, 2023, the WHOIS information for the domain was updated to:</p>
        <p><img src="https://img.urlnode.com/file/e295c2bea739e86308ab8.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 445px;"></p>
        <p>And on January 11, 2024, the WHOIS information was updated to:</p>
        <p><img src="https://pic.kkp.nz/file/ca3af0d1d9cd7024bd9f3.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 361px;"></p>
        <p>And we suddenly recalled that we had also come across the email "<strong>frank@xrun.uk</strong>" when
            reviewing the WHOIS information for the domain ho.st recently.</p>
        <p><img src="https://img.mmc199.com/file/ee0db689a60ec3508102b.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 403px;"></p>
        <p>And ho.st belongs to Host.io, a domain data provider created by the IPinfo.io team. Ho.st has been used as a
            redirect domain, making it unlikely to be easily sold independently. The fact that various email addresses
            here have all changed to "frank@xrun.uk" is evidently abnormal. However, it's easy to notice a connection
            between "frank@xrun.uk" and "meetfeifei@gmail.com."</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><strong>2024.1.15</strong> During our search, we suddenly discovered that the status of the domain "gov.cx"
            was listed as "pendingTransfer." This domain is associated with the government of Christmas Island, and such
            a situation is clearly unusual:</p>
        <p><img src="https://pic.kkp.nz/file/c3765d5eb8b48eaee000e.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 545px;"></p>
        <p>Then, as we attempted to search for other valuable domain names, we were astonished to find that a large
            number of single-character domains almost simultaneously showed a status of "pendingTransfer." They all
            share a common characteristic: being under the management of CoCCA. These domains include: <strong>e.hn,
                h.hn, o.hn, p.hn, whois.hn, i.sb, technolo.gy, ener.gy, x.cx, t.cx</strong>, and others.</p>
        <p><br></p>

        <p>----------</p>
        <p>So many single-character domain names simultaneously showing a "pendingTransfer" status, and all from
            different owners, is abnormal. However, upon learning of this situation, we didn't rush to report it to
            CoCCA. Instead, we patiently waited to see who would ultimately own this batch of domains and to which
            registrar the domains would be transferred. During these days of waiting, we continued to discover more
            domains with a "pendingTransfer" status, including <strong>4.gs, f.sb, k.hn</strong>, and others. In the
            end, we got the results we anticipated.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>In particular, "4.gs" was successfully transferred to a registrar named "InterCat Ltd," and then it was
            promptly transferred again to "West263 International Limited." Upon the transfer to "West263 International
            Limited," the WHOIS information for "4.gs" was also updated to reflect the new owner's details:</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><img src="https://tgimg.firstsonw.eu.org/file/23e757e6e296c3d9fcdd1.png" alt=""
                class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Following that, "f.sb" and "k.hn" also successfully transferred to the registrar "InterCat Ltd":</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p><img src="https://im.gurl.eu.org/file/fb04bcad2bd27a384636f.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 393px;"></p>
        <p>----------</p>
        <p><img src="https://img.zote.eu.org/file/1afbaa1c8f4d67e120020.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 406px;"></p>
        <p>The registrar known as "InterCat Ltd" (https://intercat.org), upon our inquiry, was found to be actually
            applied for by JianFei Wang himself. The information is as follows:</p>
        <p><img src="https://leoisman.pp.ua/file/c668728f61e053df628bd.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 593px;"></p>
        <p>On the bottom of its website, his contact information is also listed, and he even displays the ICANN logo,
            although he clearly cannot possess ICANN accreditation:</p>
        <p><img src="https://pic.uricc.eu.org/file/3949cb5063166ad3125f7.png" alt="" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable "
                style="width: 617px;"></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>With things having reached this point, the evidence is sufficient to indicate that the series of domain
            thefts were all orchestrated by "JianFei Wang."</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Simultaneously, upon acquiring "4.gs," "f.sb," and "k.hn," he promptly posted threads for "domain sale" on
            the forum (dalao.net). Furthermore, he listed the domain "4.gs" with a fixed price on "West263 International
            Limited" and also listed it on the Dan.com website at a significantly lower price than the market value,
            attempting to quickly liquidate the stolen assets.</p>

        <p><br></p>
        <p>Given the circumstances, in order to prevent financial losses resulting from someone purchasing the
            "ill-gotten" assets and to prevent the domains from being "Transfer" again, we felt it was unnecessary to
            wait any longer. We promptly contacted the responsible party at CoCCA and Ben Dowling, the owner of ho.st (https://twitter.com/coderholic), to report what we knew. CoCCA, upon learning of the situation,
            immediately engaged in communication with us, effectively preventing the transfer of the majority of the
            domains. CoCCA also provided us with information on domains that had undergone abnormal transfers, aligning
            closely with our findings.</p>

        <p>For the domains that have already been successfully transferred, as we are not the original owners, CoCCA has
            requested our assistance in contacting the original owners. They want the owners to file complaints with the
            original registrar or CoCCA, and based on that, they will proceed to "lock" the domains.</p>

        <p>With our efforts, we successfully contacted the original owner of "k.hn," who happened to be a Chinese
            individual. We explained the situation to them, and upon checking the registrar's website, they confirmed
            that the domain was no longer in their account. Additionally, in their email, they found a response from the
            registrar that also included the email address <strong>"frank@xrun.uk."</strong></p>

        <p><br></p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>From the emails, it's evident that JianFei Wang used the method of forging emails from the original domain
            owner to send a transfer request to the domain's original registrar/registry. He also copied the email cc to
            "frank@xrun.uk," attempting to first move the domain to his own account within the same registrar.
            Subsequently, he planned to obtain the transfer code through his own account for what can be described as a
            "theft" operation.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the domain owner, preoccupied with work, didn't promptly check the registrar's response. The
            registrar, in turn, mistakenly believed the email to be from the original owner and approved the transfer.
            Currently, the original owner of "k.hn" emphasizes the significance of the domain to him. If unable to
            recover it, he intends to report the incident to the police.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, I advised him to file complaints with the original registrar and CoCCA and on the same evening
            after sending the emails, the domains "4.gs," "f.sb," and "k.hn" were locked and displayed as
            <strong>"Registrar: Registry Hold - Suspicious Activity."</strong> The domains were temporarily taken over
            by CoCCA until the investigation was completed.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>And next, as we continued the process of digging for information, we found that "InterCat Ltd" (@InterCatLtd)
            and "JianFei Wang" (@meetfeifei) had even boldly showcased on Twitter the domains they had "acquired"
            through questionable means. Currently, both of these accounts have been cleared of relevant content, but we
            have retained evidence. One particularly amusing instance was a tweet by "InterCat Ltd" that read:</p>

        <p>Little did they know, they were the very "mouse" stealing things.</p>

        <p>With the situation at hand, though not yet concluded, we had originally planned to expose the entire incident
            next month. However, upon seeing that Max's domain had also been tampered with by JianFei Wang, and some
            details had been prematurely disclosed, we speculated that JianFei Wang would likely delete his tweets and
            vehemently deny the matter.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Therefore, we have decided to fully disclose the situation now to maintain a safe and clean domain
            environment.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Additionally, we will communicate with the victims of this incident. The estimated value of the domains
            affected by this incident is considerable. The online world is not beyond the law; it has already violated
            legal boundaries. Moreover, even if someone is overseas, they can still be report the incident to the China
            police.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>Meanwhile, JianFei Wang remains active on Twitter, attempting to deflect blame by claiming, "It has nothing
            to do with me; it was done by a hacker friend I know." However, all the evidence points to him, and there is
            no indication that he is unrelated to this incident.</p>
